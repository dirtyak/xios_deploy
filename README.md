# xios_deploy (early dev)
Bash script designed to deploy several XIOSd on your Ubuntu 17.04 VPS

this project must be validated by the team before public use

for now : USE IT AT YOUR OWN RISK

# We want this script to
git clone https//github.com/davembg/xios

compile it for ubuntu

copy it (n) times in .XIOS[1,2,3...] (make sure wallet.dat not duplicate)

config port n+1,2,3 

run them

stop them, rm them ...

# We don't want

fail - getprivkey (ugh)
